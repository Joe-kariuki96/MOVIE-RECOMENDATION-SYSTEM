# Cinematic Serendipity: Unveiling Movie Magic with FastAI
üé¨‚ú® "How's that Movie?" - A Cinematic Odyssey with Collaborative Filtering and FastAI

Welcome to a cinematic journey where 10 lines of code open the doors to an enchanting world of movie recommendations. In the realm of recommender systems, where algorithms shape our digital experiences, we unveil the artistry of collaborative filtering with a touch of FastAI wizardry.

## The Essence of Collaborative Filtering
Picture this: users with kindred cinematic spirits, influencing each other's preferences. Collaborative filtering, the maestro behind the scenes, orchestrates predictions based on shared opinions. Our twist? We're dancing with neural collaborative filtering, a modern muse in the vast landscape of recommender systems.

## Unveiling the MovieLens 100K Dataset
Our canvas is the MovieLens 100K dataset, an anthology of 100,000 movie ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies. Each user and movie, a protagonist with a unique numeric ID. Ratings, the storytellers, range from 1 to 5. Our quest? Craft a model that foretells a user's rating for an unseen movie, guided by the echoes of users with akin tastes.

## Theatrics of System Setup
To embark on this cinematic soiree, follow the script below:

bash
Copy code
pip install jovian --upgrade     # Install the jovian library 
jovian clone 5bc23520933b4cc187cfe18e5dd7e2ed # Download notebook
cd movielens-fastai              # Enter the created directory 
jovian install                   # Install the dependencies
conda activate movielens-fastai  # Activate virtual environment
jupyter notebook                 # Start Jupyter
Or, if you seek instant immersion, click "Run on Binder" for a front-row seat in the Jupyter auditorium.

## Crafting the Collaborative Symphony
In our model, users and movies take center stage as vectors of elegance. Their pas de deux, a dot product, predicts movie ratings. But there's an encore! We introduce bias terms for the dramatic outliers and an exquisite sigmoid touch for a refined denouement.

python
Copy code
learn = collab_learner(data, n_factors=40, y_range=[0,5.5], wd=.1)
## Rehearsing the Model
Training unfolds seamlessly with the FastAI repertoire. Let the learning rate finder set the stage, and a mere 5 epochs later, witness the mean squared error bowing to around 0.80, achieving a state-of-the-art crescendo.

python
Copy code
learn.fit_one_cycle(5, 0.01)
Spectacle of Predictions
Enough of the rehearsals; let's shine the spotlight on real predictions!

python
Copy code
(users, items), ratings = next(iter(data.valid_dl))
preds = learn.model(users, items)
print('Real\tPred\tDifference')
for p in list(zip(ratings, preds))[:16]:
    print('{}\t{:.1f}\t{:.1f}'.format(p[0],p[1],p[1]-p[0]))
Marvel at the predictions, dancing in harmony with actual ratings. Now, let this model serenade you with recommendations that echo your cinematic soul. üåüüé•
