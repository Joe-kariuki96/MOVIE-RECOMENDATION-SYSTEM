# Movie Recommendation System based on Ratings with AI
## Overview
Welcome to the movie recommendation system based on ratings with AI! This project combines collaborative filtering and artificial intelligence to deliver personalized movie suggestions based on user ratings. Whether you're a cinephile or just looking for your next favorite film, this system is designed to provide tailored recommendations, taking into account your unique taste and preferences.
## How it Works
### Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is at the heart of this recommendation system. By analyzing user ratings and identifying patterns of similarity between users, the system can suggest movies that align with your preferences. If users who have rated movies similarly to you have also enjoyed other films, those movies are recommended to you.
## Artificial Intelligence
The AI component enhances the collaborative filtering process by leveraging advanced algorithms. These algorithms continuously learn from user behavior, adapting to changing preferences and providing increasingly accurate recommendations over time. The more you interact with the system, the better it becomes at understanding your tastes.
